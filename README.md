This is a program made using an Android development tool and programmed in Java. This is a simple “Story Writer Helper” app that generates random snippets of strings that can be used to help in the development of stories. The layout contains the display box for the string and a “Help” button that the user clicks to generate a random story snippet. The app contains an array of strings that can be used and chooses a random string that is displayed when the Help button is clicked. The app also removes the string from the array after it is generated so that all of the strings will be generated at least once before any repeated strings occur. After all of the strings have been generated, the list is reset and the user can generate all of the strings once again.
